We care about your privacy. This Privacy Notice describes the data that Mozilla (that's us) receives from your use of Firefox online services (the "Services"), how we use it, and your choices.

- We do not share this data with others and we use it solely to provide you with the Services.  If you request to have your Firefox account deleted, we will no longer retain this information.
- The Services use cookies and other web technologies to provide functionality (such as remembering you between sessions).  We use aggregate analytics to help us understand how users engage with the Services.
