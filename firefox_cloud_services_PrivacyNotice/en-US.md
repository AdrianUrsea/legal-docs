We care about your privacy. When Firefox Cloud Services (the "Services") sends information to Mozilla (that's us) our [Mozilla Privacy Policy](https://www.mozilla.org/privacy/) describes how we use that information.

## Things you should know:

You send us different types of data depending on what features of the Services you use.  Learn More.

* **Firefox Account**: When you sign up for an account, we receive your email address and a hash of your password.  In addition, you may optionally add a profile image.  If you choose Gravatar, we'll share your email address with Gravatar to obtain your profile image.
* **Sync**: If you use Sync, we receive a variety of information to synchronize your tabs, awesome bar, passwords, bookmarks, browser preferences and other data across devices.
* **Find My Device**: If you enable Find My Device, we receive the approximate location of your device only when you sign into your Firefox Account and specifically request us to locate a connected device.  While signed in, you can see your device’s last known locations on a map.  We regularly delete these locations and will not collect further locations until you request us to.
