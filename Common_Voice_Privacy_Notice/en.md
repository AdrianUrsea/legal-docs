# Common Voice Privacy Notice 

Effective May 1, 2018 {: datetime="2018-05-01" }

## Privacy

When Mozilla (thatâ€™s us), receives information from you, our [Mozilla Privacy Policy](https://www.mozilla.org/privacy) describes how we handle that information.

* **Demographic data.** You can optionally send us information such as your accent, age, and gender. This helps us and other researchers improve and create speech-to-text technology and tools.

* **Email data.** You can optionally create an account or subscribe to our newsletter in which case we receive your email address. This is associated with your demographic and interaction data but is not shared to the public.

* **Voice Recordings.** Voice recordings, along with any associated demographic data, may be available in the Common Voice database for public consumption and use.

* **Text.** If you submit written sentences, we may also make those available in the Common Voice database for public consumption and use. We will not associate these sentences with the demographic data you submit. 

* **Interaction data.** We use Google Analytics to better understand how you interact with the Common Voice app or website. For example, this includes number of voice samples you record or listen to, interactions with buttons and menus, session length.

* **Technical data.** Using Google Analytics, we collect the URL and title of the Common Voice pages you visit. We collect your browser, viewport size, and screen resolution. We also collect your location, and the language setting in your browser.
