## At Mozilla, we believe that privacy is fundamental to a healthy internet.

That’s why we build Firefox Rocket, and all our products, to give you greater control over the information you share online and the information you share with us. We strive to collect only what we need to improve Rocket for everyone.
 
In this Privacy Notice, we explain what data Rocket shares and point you to settings to share even less. We also adhere to the practices outlined in the Mozilla [privacy policy](https://www.mozilla.org/privacy/) for how we receive, handle and share information we collect from Rocket.

## Firefox Rocket by default shares data to:

### Improve performance and stability for users everywhere

* __Interaction data__: Rocket sends data about your interactions with Rocket to us (number of webpages visited; and session length) and Rocket features offered by Mozilla or our partners (such as interaction with Rocket search features and search partner referrals).

* __Technical data__: Rocket sends data about your Rocket version and language; device operating system and hardware configuration; memory, basic information about crashes and errors; outcome of automated processes like updates, and activation to us.  When Rocket sends data to us, your IP address is temporarily collected as part of our server logs.  

Read detailed documentation for Rocket [here](https://github.com/mozilla-tw/Rocket/wiki/Telemetry) or learn how to [opt-out](https://support.mozilla.org/kb/send-performance-data-improve-firefox) of this data collection.

### Suggest relevant content

Rocket displays content, such as Top Sites (websites suggested by Mozilla for first-time Rocket users).

* __Technical & Interaction data__: Rocket sends us data such as the position, size and placement of content we suggest, as well as basic data about your interactions with Rocket's suggested content. This includes the number of times suggested content is displayed or clicked.


### Measure and support our marketing

* __Referral and Campaign Data__: To help improve our marketing campaigns, Rocket may use “Referral Data” such as the website domain or advertising campaign that referred you to download and install Rocket. This data is kept by our analytics vendor and provided when you start Rocket, and also includes an iOS Vendor ID or Google advertising ID, timestamp, country, locale, operating system, and app version.

## If you use these features, Rocket will share data to provide functionality:  {: #optional-features }

### Search

You can perform searches directly from the search bar in Rocket.  _Mozilla does not receive your search queries._ Query data is sent to your search provider, which has its own privacy policy.  

* __Search Suggestions__: Rocket by default sends search queries to your search provider to help you discover common phrases other people have searched for and improve your search experience. These data will not be sent if your selected search provider does not support search suggestions.

### Location {: #location-services }

* __Location data to Google's geolocation service__: Rocket always asks before determining and sharing your location with a requesting website (for example, if a map website needs your location to provide directions).  To determine location, Rocket may use your operating system’s geolocation features, Wi-fi networks, cell phone towers, or IP address, and may send this data to Google's geolocation service, which has its own [privacy policy](https://www.google.com/privacy/lsf.html).
