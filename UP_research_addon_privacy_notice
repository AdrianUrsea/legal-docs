#Mozilla Personalization Study - Terms of Use & Privacy Notice

Updated:  July 30, 2014

Mozilla cares about your privacy. When _____ sends information to us, our Mozilla Privacy Policy describes how we handle that information.

##Things you should know

Mozilla is considering a web personalization feature for Firefox that puts users in control of what data is shared and with whom. This Study analyzes user engagement with personalized content, non-personalized content, and browser history to help us determine which personalization methods, if any, are most engaging to Firefox users.

* *What information do you receive?**: Each time you visit a new https supported website we receive the hostname (not the full URL) of the website to run a vulnerability check. Firefox caches the status locally and re-checks it at regular intervals to notify you of updates. We don't keep logs of IP addresses and cannot identify you or your browsing history.

* **What else can I do?**: Clicking on the icon gives you an option to clear cookies. If you select this option, Firefox will automatically clear cookies from each site you visit as an additional protection against the Heartbleed Bug.
