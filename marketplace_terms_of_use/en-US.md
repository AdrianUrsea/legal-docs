### Summary

This top section is a summary of the terms below. It is provided as an aid to your understanding - but be sure to read the entire document, because when you agree to it, you are indicating you accept all of it, not just this summary:

- You must be at least 18 years old to have an account on the Marketplace or have your parent consent and supervise your use of the Marketplace.
- Our use of your data will be in accordance with our [Firefox Marketplace privacy policy](/privacy-policy). Apps or Add-ons provided by others may have their own privacy policy.

- You&rsquo;ll be responsible for your use or misuse of the Firefox Marketplace, Apps or Add-ons.

### Introduction

At Mozilla, we are committed to promoting choice and innovation on the web. That&rsquo;s why we created the Firefox Marketplace â€“ a publicly available market that allows developers to distribute their Apps or Add-ons to users for use on any device that can access the open web.

Your use of the Firefox Marketplace is subject to the terms and conditions of this Terms of Use as well as the related Firefox Marketplace policies referred to in these Terms or in the Firefox Marketplace (we will refer to these collectively as the &ldquo;Terms&rdquo;).


### Eligibility

By using the Firefox Marketplace, you agree that you are at least 18 years old or are acting with the consent and supervision of your parent; and you have full power, capacity, and authority to accept these Terms on behalf of yourself, or if applicable, your employer or other entity that you represent.


### Modifications to the Terms

We reserve the right to change these Terms at our sole discretion, and if we do make material changes, we will notify you.


### Definitions

When we use the word &ldquo;Developers&rdquo;, we mean third party developers who make their Marketplace Content available through the Firefox Marketplace.

You can install Add-ons or Apps (together, &ldquo;Marketplace Content&rdquo;) through the Firefox Marketplace:

- &ldquo;Add-ons&rdquo; are extensions, themes, search providers, dictionaries, and language packs that allow you to extend the functionality of the Firefox browser.
- &ldquo;Apps&rdquo; are applications written using open web technologies that can run on multiple platforms.
- Some Apps and Add-ons may be purchased from developers through the Firefox Marketplace (each, a &ldquo;Purchased&rdquo; App or Add-on and together, &ldquo;Purchased Content&rdquo;).


### Marketplace Content

Each Developer, not Mozilla (except where we develop our own Apps or Add-ons), is solely responsible for their Add-ons and Apps.


### Purchased Content

The Firefox Marketplace uses Mozilla [Persona](https://persona.org/) to tie your Purchased Content to your account. You won&rsquo;t be able to use any Purchased Content without logging in with your Persona account. If you delete your Persona account, you may lose your Purchased Content. Developers may offer products and services that require you to log in or authenticate using additional credentials aside from Persona.

By purchasing Purchased Content, you agree not to intentionally circumvent any authentication mechanism. We may stop providing access to the Firefox Marketplace or suspend your access to Purchased Content if we believe that you have violated these terms.


### Refunds & Support

Unless otherwise noted, the Marketplace Content listed in the Firefox Marketplace is developed and sold by third-party Developers, not Mozilla. For this reason, any support requests you have that are related to Marketplace Content have to be made to the Developer of that Marketplace Content. To request support for Marketplace Content you have purchased, please contact the Developer of that Marketplace content through that Marketplace Content&rsquo;s listing page.

You can also request support from the mobile network operator on which you are accessing the Firefox Marketplace (a list of carrier support websites are available [here](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US
